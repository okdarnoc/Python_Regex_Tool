Chapter 3 
Scene: Lucifer's Office

Lucifer "So, you've visited all the people I instructed you to see?"
Andrew "I have."
Lucifer "Interesting."
Lucifer "Out of curiosity…"
Lucifer "Who had the most compelling case?"

#Who should I pick?

@1. Edwin

Andrew "Edwin seems to think that Sebastian should not get off so easily."
Andrew "If Sebastian is really as evil as Edwin says he is…"
Andrew "You and I are honestly terrible people for trying to free him."
Lucifer "Ha! Truer words have never been spoken!"

@2. Sebastian

Andrew "Sebastian is by no means a good person…"
Andrew "But he raised some compelling points."
Andrew "Maybe it's better to sacrifice one life for the sake of many."
Lucifer "I'd be cautious about who you pick fights with, Andrew."
Lucifer "You never know who may be lurking in the darkness."

@3. Cassandra

Andrew "Cass...my wife thinks I'm a total failure."
Andrew "As each day passes, it gets harder to argue the opposite."
Andrew "Her idyllic sentiments really got through to me."
Lucifer "Don't be going soft on me now, Andrew!"
Lucifer "We're not even halfway to being done."

#End

Lucifer "At the end of the day, each party's power of persuasion is irrelevant."
Lucifer "You will do as I instruct or things will go south very quickly."
Lucifer "Are we clear about that?"
Andrew (Is it so cut and dry?) 
Andrew (Is there no alternative than to follow Lucifer's crazy scheme?)
Lucifer "Are we clear, Andrew"
Andrew "Crystal."
Lucifer "Lovely. Then; your next assignment."
Lucifer "From what you've told me, our witness is still planning to sing."
Lucifer "That leaves us with no alternative."
Andrew "You mean…"
Lucifer "Do what needs to be done."

Scene: Sidewalk (Night)

Am I really going to have to kill this witness?
I've only ever killed one person before.
A hostage situation that turned bleak…
Even in such a scenario, pulling back that trigger still haunts me.

# Flashback Start

Edwin "He and whoever he deals with needs to be persecuted for taking a man's life."
Edwin "Anyone able to commit such an act does not deserve to retain their own."

# Flashback End


By Edwin's standards, I'm already irredeemable.
If only something would happen to lead me in the right direction.

Andrew "Is anybody out there!"
Andrew "Please, I don't know what to do next!"
Andrew "Just give me some kind of sign!"

Suddenly, a hooded man stops me in the street asking for directions.

??? "Hey man, could you tell me how to get to the bank?"
Andrew "Sorry, I don't know." 
??? "Come on man, I know you're holding out on me."
Andrew "I'm kind of busy at the moment so you'll have to excuse me."
??? "Don't be like that...Andrew."
Andrew "How do you-?"

Without warning, a large bag is thrown over my head from behind.
My wrists are cuffed and I can feel my body being thrown into the back of a car.
As the sound of tire burnout rings in my ears, all I can think is this:

??? "You should be careful where you go sticking your nose, Andrew"
??? "You don't know what may be on the receiving end."

I shouldn't have asked for that sign.
